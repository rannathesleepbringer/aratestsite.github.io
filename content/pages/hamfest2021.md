It is important to note that this special event hamfest will be more of a tailgating event and less of the Great Hagerstown Hamfest that we have all come to know and love. 

*A few things that you **should not expect** are:*
*  ~~Food Concessions~~
*  ~~Inside Vendors~~
*  ~~Speakers~~

Things are still in flux as to what we will and will not do, but those three seem to be the main ones that keep getting mentioned. 

*What you **can expect** are:*
*  Tailgaing
*  Chance at some really good deals
*  Fun
*  Lower ticket cost this year
*  Bathroom facilities
*  Door Prizes
*  Camaradarie
*  Lower ticket Prices
*  A perfect change to see your friends!
*  Great deals! (yes, I know this is repeated, but it's true!)

The organizers are going to reach out to some vendors and invite them to attend our tailgate fest. We are not sure how this will turn out, but wouldn't it be great if several larger vendors showed up to tailgate along with the rest of us? When they do, please remember to thank them, and to buy their wares to help solidify that thank you! 

All new information from this point forward will be noted as such, and will likely be at the top of the page.
