## About the Club  
Welcome to the Antietam Radio Association, or ARA for short.  It is our hope that you'll enjoy your visit to our website and will return often.  The Antietam Radio Association is located in Hagerstown Maryland, and services the Four State area.  

The Antietam Radio Association is a general interest club, which supports all modes of operation, and provides strong support to RACES (Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service).  

## Meeting Information
*The Antietam Radio Association holds its meetings on the first and third Tuesday of most months.* **The ARA does not hold an Activities Meeting (second meeting) in July, August, and depending on the calendar, December).**

The activities meetings, which take place on the third Tuesday of each month, are usually preceded by an informal pre-meeting social for food and drink at the American Legion on Northern Ave in Hagerstown. Each member picks up her/her own tab. 

Through Covid-19, which was most of 2020 and the early part of 2021, we tested several methods of hosting meetings via Webex, over the air on the 146.94 repeater, and Zoom.  Beginning with the first meeting in May 2021, we've begun to resume in-person meetings, but are keeping a close eye on local, state and federal governments to ensure we adhere to any and all restrictions. 

We are fortunate to have stable venues:

### Pre-meeting socials are held on the *third* Tuesday from 5:00 PM to 6:30 PM at:
- American Legion  
  405 Northern Avenue  
  Hagerstown, MD 21742 

### Meetings begin at 7:00PM at:
- St. John's Lutheran Church  
  Education Building  
  Second Floor  
  141 South Potomac Street  
  Hagerstown, MD 21740
