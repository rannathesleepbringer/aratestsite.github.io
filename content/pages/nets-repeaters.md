## Nets

The Antietam Radio Association sponsors five nets that address a variety of interests. All licensed amateurs are welcome to participate:

- ARES NET  
    The monthly Washington County ARES FM Net is held on the last Thursday of each month at 7:00 PM. It is held on the 146.94 repeater, PL tone 100.0. 
    
- ARES FUSION NET  
    ARES FUSION NET follows the monthly ARES net at 7:30 PM and is held on the 447.975 W3CWC repeater. The Fusion net uses Yaesuâ€™s C4FM 4-level FSK Technology to transmit digital voice and gives net participants the chance to practice using this mode and exercise their Fusion equipment.

-  ARA 4-STATES NET  
     Held each Wednesday at 8:00 PM on the 147.09 repeater (PL tone 100.0), it offers weekly updates of club news and activities and the chance to chat with other club members.

- The SIX METER NET  
    This net is a more informal net that follows the Four States Net. It is held weekly at about 8:30 PM on 50.151 MHZ USB and is hosted by Herm, K2AVA, to give participants the chance to exercise their 6 meter equipment.

#### *The NEW HAMS NET is taking some time away from the microphone -- we will re-evaluate after the summer*
- NEW HAMS NET   
    The ARA recently started a New Hams Net, held on the first and third Thursdays of each month at 8PM. The net alternates between the 146.94 repeater, PL 100 Hz (first Thursday) and the 147.090 repeater, PL 100 Hz (third Thursday). This net offers newly licensed amateurs a helpful and no pressure environment to practice operating their equipment and learn net operation etiquette. Amateurs who would like to practice or to help assist newcomers are welcome.
