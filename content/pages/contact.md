You may contact many members of the ARA via email, telephone or send directly to the club's Post Office Box.

*  *General Email:* **admin@w3cwc.com**  
This is a monitored email inbox, though it may take a few days to receive a reply, since the the one monitoring the box may not be the one who can best answer your question.
<!---
*  *Phone Number:* **301-842-6221**  
We do not have a direct phone number, per se, however, the Secretary of the ARA has provided a Google Voice phone number to help differentiate ARA calls from private calls. Please note that call may not be answered immediately, but please do leave a message, and your call will be returned.

*  *Mailing Address:*   
**Antietam Radio Association**  
**Post Office Box 52**  
**Hagerstown, MD 21741-0052**  

This page will be updated with more points of contact as permission to post them on the site is granted.
