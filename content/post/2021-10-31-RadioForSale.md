**[UPDATE!]**  
The Icom IC7200 has been sold; still available are the Icom AH-4 remote antenna tuner ($175) and Icom SM-30 desk microphone ($125). Other items may also be available. [CLICK HERE to see his Marketplace, which has also been updated.](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/1007176256523565/). 

[Editor's Note: Parts of the following text was taken from an email that I received from club member Adam Karsin]  

> So, I have decided to sell my Icom IC-7200. I bought it with portable operations in mind, and have gone a completely different direction.  Please see my marketplace listing here: https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/1007176256523565/.
> 
> I can also be reached directly at KG4WWH@gmail.com. **Please put IC-7200 in the subject** so I can keep it out of the spam filter.

I took the description (below) directly from [**Adam's marketplace listing**](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/1007176256523565/), just in case there are any who might be intersted, but would rather not get entwined with social media:

> Up for sale is an Icom IC-7200 with box, with all paperwork and original accessories.  
> Included in this sale is the following:
> * AT-180 auto tuner with 13 pin accessory cable
> * AH-4 auto tuner. This has had the following modification: https://www.qsl.net/v73ns/AH4.html
> * Icom SM-30 desk mic (less than a year old).

>Radio works great, last on the air was today (October 30, 2021). I originally purchased the radio with the intent of installing it in a rack mount case for traveling, camping etc. I ended up going a completely different route and now the radio doesnâ€™t see much airtime. 
>   
> I am asking $1200 plus shipping for everything.  Local pickup is available.  Shipping is available, but Facebook Marketplace will not let me select that as an option. (it also doesn't have Ham Radio as an option either.)
