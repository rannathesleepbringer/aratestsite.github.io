Thanks to Covid-19, the entire world faced a devastating 2020 -- it seemed that the entire world was put on a *major* pause.  The year 2021 shows that people seem to have a little more confidence to step outside, now that the health and government officials have had a chance to get vaccines and other safeguards in place.

Many events, including hamfests, have cautiously re-opened their doors to their community, and Antietam Radio is no exception. You may remember that much earlier this year the ARA membership voted to **cancel the MAY 2021 Hamfest**, but remained hopeful that things would take a turn for the better, and we could attempt a modified hamfest/tailgate fest later this fall. That event was announced at the last ARA meeting August 3rd.

It is important to note that this special event hamfest will be more of a tailgating event and less of the Great Hagerstown Hamfest that we have all come to know and love. *A few things that you should not expect are:*
*  Food Concessions
*  Inside Vendors
*  Speakers

Things are still in flux as to what we will and will not do, but those three seem to be the main ones that keep getting mentioned. *What you can expect are:*
*  Tailgaing
*  Chance at some really good deals
*  Fun
*  Lower ticket cost this year [(see the Hamfest Page for detailed pricing)](/page/hamfest2021/)
*  Bathroom facilities
*  Door Prizes
*  Camaradarie
*  Lower ticket Prices
*  A perfect change to see your friends!
*  Great deals! (yes, I know this is repeated, but it's true!)

There will be more posted on [the ARA Hamfest page](/page/hamfest2021/) as more things are determined....
