This content was born from an effort to help a new
ham that had reached out. This request motivated me to work on the ARA site, and to include a short list of
different options that I had used or with which I was already
familiar (W5YI.ORG, ARRL.ORG, and
KB6NU.COM).

I will be updating and expanding this section as time permits, but since a good portion of my time is now used rebuilding the ARA site, I am adding a few links to those places I found of great benefit. 

- [The W5YI Group](https://w5yi.org) (When the ARA holds its own classes, we use their books).    
- [KB6NU.com](https://kb6nu.com) (I found his tech and general books very helpful).    
- [HamStudy.org](https://hamstudy.org) (This site has just about everything that you would ever need, including links to other, unaffiliated, study sites).  
- [ARRL Exam Study Prep](https://www.arrl.org/studying-for-a-technician-license) (always an option).
