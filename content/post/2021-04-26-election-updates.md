Initially, we didn't have a full slate of candidates; that is until a past president, Brian Umbrell (W3PDW), was nominated for and accepted the challenge to run for the office of President.

With his acceptance, we now have a full slate of officers.  Please note:  This *doesn't* mean that nominations are closed -- far from it!  The ARA will accept nominations for any office or for a directorship until the election on May 4, 2021. As well, write-ins are also an option.
