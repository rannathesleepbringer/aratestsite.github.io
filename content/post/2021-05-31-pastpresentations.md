We have had quite a few very relevant, well done and interesting presentations over the years -- we hope to add all recent presentations, and where possible, those that happened in the not so recent past. Each presenter must give consent before it is published on W3CWC.ORG.

We are going to start with the most recent Activities presentation, given by Gary De Palma, AC8NE. He gave a very interesting and timely report on the most recent changes to the FCC rules dealing with RF Evaluations and Safety, and how amateur radio operators are affected. 

The "Presentations" page is under RESOURCES, on the top menu. (RESOURCES > PRESENTATIONS) The list of [available presentations](/page/presentations) will be in a list format; clicking on any link will open that presentation.
