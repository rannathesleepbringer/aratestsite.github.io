The Mountain Club of Maryland is holding its biennial [**Hike Across Maryland**](https://mcomd.org/?page_id=1643) on May 7, 2022. The Frederick Amatuer Radio Club will provide communications support for the event, staffing checkpoints and relaying hiker progress information.  

The hike starts at PenMark Park near Cascade, MD and works south to Harper's Ferry, WV.  

FARC has reached out to the ARA, and offered the opportunity to volunteer alongside them to provide additional support for during the event.  If you are eager to volunteer for a very worthwhile cause (or  maybe to exercise some new-to-you ham gear you had just purchased at the [**Great Hagerstown Hamfest**](/hamfest/), then please read this [**more detailed flyer about what to expect to learn how you can volunteer click this link**](/images/HamforHAM.pdf).
