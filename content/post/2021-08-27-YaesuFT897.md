We may have been a little light on hamfests this year, but the number of radios that have been circulating between us seems to be steady...

Our Secretary, K3WJC, was contacted by a gentleman who would like to sell his recently purchased, lightly used rig; Bill is acting as the go between for now. Up for grabs is a Yaesu FT897D, for which the owner is asking $800. As far as condition, pictures are below. If you are interested, please contact K3WJC (Bill Collins) @ colli020@gmail.com; you may also call his cell (304-676-9391), but please be aware that you will most likely get voice mail. Read more for images.

Of course, if the radio does not sell here, the owner may always try and sell it at the TailgateFest!!
