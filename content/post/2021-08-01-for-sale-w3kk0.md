Optional DSP module installed.
No zebra stripes or missing pixels on the display.  

Includes long power cord, factory MH31 hand microphone and mobile mounting bracket (2 screws are missing). No mods done so it does **not** transmit on 60m.

I'm the second owner, it had some scratches and rubs when I got it, [plus] a few more in mobile and portable use over 3+ years.  Works well.

Asking $500. [Click for larger image](/images/20210725_082246.jpg)
