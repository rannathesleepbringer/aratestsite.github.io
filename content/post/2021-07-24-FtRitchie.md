This is ARA member Garry Laing -- I am serving as Net Control for the [2021 Fort Ritchie Triathlon](https://racinemultisports.com/frt/). **I am *looking for a few volunteers* to help with communications support** during the biking portion of the event. The race is Sunday, August 1, starting at approximately 7:30 am. 
<!--more-->
The ARA has provided this race with 2 meter radio communications for quite a few years, but this year (due to other commitments and/or opportunities) three positions remain open.  **Can you help by providing communications along the route?**  You can use the mobile unit in your car, or your handheld, as I do. 

You will be positioned at one location during the bike race, and duties include calling Net Control for pickup of injured riders or mechanical failures (flat tire, broken chain).  For our own safety, we hold an hourly check in.
 
The swim, run, and bicycle race runs from 7:30 am to approximately 12-12:30PM. Luckily, *you* will not have to swim, run, or ride.
 
Please email me, Garry Laing, at gtlaing@yahoo.com if you can and are able to "work."
