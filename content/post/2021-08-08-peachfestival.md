Herman Niedzielski (K2AVA), ARA VP, recently received approval from the Lietersburg Ruritan to have a booth at the [2021 Annual Peach Festival](https://leitersburgruritan.org/peach-festival) this coming weekend, August 14th and 15th; 9AM to 5PM.

We are vividly aware of the compressed timeframe, and we are hoping to scramble as many volunteers as possible to staff the the Antietam Radion Assn exhibit. Volunteers will meet an greet the public, answer questions about ham radio, and serve as a spokeperson for the ARA, as well as for the Amateur Radio Service in general.   

We will have our 10x10 canopy and table, a radio, an MFJ CW keyer/reader, some books, pamphlets, our table cover and usual signage. **The one missing ingredient is you!** *This is an invitation for those willing to help!! [Call or email Herm](mailto:k2ava@myactv.net) (see below) to let him when you are free to volunteer.*  

We have done much more in less time -- yes, it would have been a good idea to have tentatively gotten volunteers a month or two ago, but with the recently built Community Center and its inherited layout, the feasibility of the ARA booth remained unclear until now. Several of newer members were attendees at our booth in years past, and it is an excellent opportunity to visit with friends, talk radio, and to just *HAM it up!* We are hoping for another successful presentation at the Peach Festival this year.  

*We can only operate a booth if we have the manpower to staff it.* Please let Herm know before Thursday if you would like to volunteer, so that he has the time necessary to plan appropriately.

*Pass it on!!* Herm's email and phone number are below:
