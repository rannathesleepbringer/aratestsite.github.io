The first order of business that we tackled (the first of its kind for a very long time) was to take roll, shortly followed by voting for club officers for the upcoming terms. 
<!--more-->
Since there were no competition for any office, Herm motioned for an up-down vote (show of hands) to elect the current candidates, rather than by paper ballot. The motion was seconded and carried. 

The new officers for 2021-22 are:
Office|Name|Call
---|---|---
President|Brian Umbrell|W3PDW
Vice President|Herm Niedzielski|K2AVA
Treasurer|Tim Keener|K2AVA
Activities Dir|Steve Struharik|WA8EIH
Secretary|Bill Collins|K3WJC
Director|Pat Goodrich|KB3YSV
Director|Karin Christensen|KB3GFV
Director|Nelson Sollenberger|KA2C

Newly elected club officials are installed during the first meeting of June.
