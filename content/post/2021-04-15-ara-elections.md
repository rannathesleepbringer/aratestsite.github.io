The Antietam Radio Association's bylaws mandate that we have an election each year for a new slate of officers -- according to our current president, Butch (NI2W), the attempts to band together a nominating committee have not been as successful as hoped. He, as the president and having little unilateral authority, recently proposed the following in an email sent to the members of the Executive Board:

“... I propose all individuals now holding office be submitted as candidates for the upcoming May 4 election unless they choose otherwise.” Citing the need to reduce his workload, he's decided not to run for another term. He clarified, however, that he *does* intend to continue in his roles as the ARRL EC and RACES officer, as well a few other commitments to which has agreed (such as Field Day Support Chair). “My time as president has been enjoyable...,” he said, and that he greatly appreciates how our club members supported him and the club during the trying, unknowing times of Covid-19.  

Below is a very recent email from Butch dated April 15, 2021:

>SUBJECT: Upcoming ARA Election  
>
>Election of Antietam Radio Officers for the 2021-2022 period is scheduled for the ARA meeting on May 4th. The positions are President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, Activities Director and three Directors. It is now time to submit your nominations for these various positions. *As of this date the ARA has only two nominations for officer positions.*  
>
>If you are interested in nominating someone, or yourself, for an officer position please send your nomination to me. Nominations will be open until the meeting on May 4th. Please consider supporting the ARA by becoming an officer.

As I close this article, I am reminded of what I've heard so many times before -- and not just about the ARA, but all organizations -- this is *your* club/organization, and you only get out of what you put in.  

I look forward to seeing many of you at the next meeting, which is scheduled for the Zoom platform, April 20, 2021, at 7P. Credentials will be emailed and posted as the meeting draws nearer.
