### EZNEC is now free, and available for download at https://www.eznec.com/.  

Nelson Sollenberger gave a very informative presentation to the membership of the Antietam Radio Association during the March Activities Meeting covering use of EZNEC, specifically related to the HAM Community.  He was also kind enough to provide a PDF version of his Powerpoint presenation for use on W3CWC.ORG.....

We also have a link directly to his site, as well as one that takes us directly to some of the .EZ files (those that are used with EZNEC) that he used during the presentation, along with many more!
