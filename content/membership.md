Whether you are an "old-timer" within the wireless hobby, or are brand new to amateur radio, the Antietam Radio Association is a great place to meet new people and to learn more about the art, science and skill of Amateur Radio.

The Federal Communications Commission established the Amateur Radio Service in 1912, which requires a license to transmit on the many frequencies the Commission reserved for the use of the Amateur Radio Service. Being part of a club raises the enjoyment you will get from being an amateur radio operator. With that in mind, if you are within the regional Hagerstown area, join us!

If you are not located within a reasonable distance, we still encourage you to find a club close to you ... a good starting point is the [ARRL's club search](http://www.arrl.org/find-a-club). 

If are relatively near Hagerstown, MD, then by all means, join us for our next meeting! We have re-established in-person meetings as May, 2021. [**Click here for meeting information, including location and times/dates.**](/page/meeting-info). Membership is not required to attend a meeting (or evens multiple meetings); they are open to all who are interested.

[**Click here for the Membership Application Form**](/images/Application_Form.pdf). Please print the application out and mail to the ARA or bring with you to the next meeting.
