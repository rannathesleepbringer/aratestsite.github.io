>   **THE HUB CITY DINER**  
>   **190 Railroad Lane**

We host the breakfast on the last Saturday of each month, and it's a great time for eyeball QSOs with people you've spoken to over the air, or just to meet up with friends you haven't seen for while. 

Officially, the breakfast starts at 9:00 AM, but it is always a good idea to come a little early to make sure that you get a good seat.
