Please note that we recently had a revision, which is not yet included within the PDF. It will be included in the next PDF.

Specifically, the revision concerns whether in-person meetings more, less or equally authoritative as those held over the air, Zoom, or other methods. The newly approved wording is below:

>Article V â€” Meetings of Members  
>>Section 8. Meeting Access  
>>>C. All meetings, when called by the President, whether they are in person meetings, online meetings or over the air meetings, shall be considered legal meetings. Any business conducted shall be considered binding with proper voting procedures.
